Несколько выводов данной программы:

for 1000000 generated strings: 
 - RSHash has 44306 collisions
 - JSHash has 44326 collisions
 - PJWHash has 49073 collisions
 - ELFHash has 49073 collisions
 - BKDRHash has 44285 collisions
 - SDBMHash has 44285 collisions
 - DJBHash has 44286 collisions
 - DEKHash has 44987 collisions
 - APHash has 44326 collisions

for 1000000 generated strings: 
 - RSHash has 43817 collisions
 - JSHash has 43820 collisions
 - PJWHash has 48580 collisions
 - ELFHash has 48580 collisions
 - BKDRHash has 43812 collisions
 - SDBMHash has 43819 collisions
 - DJBHash has 43805 collisions
 - DEKHash has 44500 collisions
 - APHash has 43821 collisions

for 1000000 generated strings: 
 - RSHash has 44342 collisions
 - JSHash has 44353 collisions
 - PJWHash has 49182 collisions
 - ELFHash has 49182 collisions
 - BKDRHash has 44330 collisions
 - SDBMHash has 44337 collisions
 - DJBHash has 44314 collisions
 - DEKHash has 45010 collisions
 - APHash has 44346 collisions

Вывод: особенно плохи (примерно на 10% хуже остальных) PJW и ELF, также выделяется DEK
